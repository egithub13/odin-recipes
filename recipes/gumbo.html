    <p>Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's 
        shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick 
        stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, 
        sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.

    <h2>Directions</h2>  
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings 
        in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. 
        Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany 
        brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully 
        and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue 
        whisking until mixture stops cooking.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic 
        into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables 
        are very finely chopped.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a 
        simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 
        10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot 
        and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, 
        then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, 
        Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. 
        Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder 
        at the 45-minute mark.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. 
        Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, 
        and stir into the simmering gumbo.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, 
        and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more 
        teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
